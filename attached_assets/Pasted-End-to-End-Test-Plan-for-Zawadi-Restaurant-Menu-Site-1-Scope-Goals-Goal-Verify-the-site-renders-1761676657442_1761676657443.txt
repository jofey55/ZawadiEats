End-to-End Test Plan for Zawadi Restaurant Menu Site
1) Scope & Goals

Goal: Verify the site renders perfectly on mobile/desktop, all menu items & toppings behave as intended, prices & options are correct, and the UX (speed, accessibility, navigation) is production-ready.
Out of scope (unless noted): 3rd-party delivery integrations, payment gateways, POS sync.

2) Test Environments

Staging URL: <provide> (no indexing; “noindex” meta + robots.txt)

Production URL: <provide> (for final smoke test only)

Build: Static build (dist/) with consistent asset hashes; include SPA rewrites if applicable.

3) Device & Browser Matrix

Test each below at portrait/landscape (mobile) and 100%/125% zoom (desktop):

Mobile: iPhone 12/13/14/15 (iOS Safari), iPhone SE (small viewport), Pixel 6/7/8 (Android Chrome), Samsung Galaxy S21/S22/S23 (Android Chrome).

Tablet: iPad (Safari), Galaxy Tab (Chrome).

Desktop: Windows 11 (Edge, Chrome, Firefox), macOS (Safari, Chrome).

Pass criteria: No layout shift, text overlap, cut-off content, or hidden buttons at any breakpoint.

4) Core Functional Test Suites
A. Navigation & Structure

Header/nav appears on all pages; active state highlights correctly.

Category pages exist and show expected items; non-clickable tiles are removed or fixed (earlier issue).

Footer links, contact info (address, phone, email), and hours visible and correct.

404 page renders with a path back to Home.

B. Menu Logic & Toppings Rules (critical)

Use these source-of-truth rules when reviewing logic:

Fruit Bowl toppings: Tahini and/or lime squeeze only.

No protein, no hot sauces; prevent chicken/beef bowl toppings from appearing.

Quesadillas:

Hot side only toppings like chicken/beef bowl hot toppings.

“Double meat” option must match the base protein (double chicken if base is chicken).

Cold side guacamole is on the side (not mixed in by default).

Add fries option available on all bowls and quesadillas (single size only; no size selector).

Chicken vs Beef bowls can share appropriate toppings, but fruit bowls must not inherit bowl toppings.

Pricing reflects extras (e.g., Quinoa (extra $), Pineapple (extra $), Watermelon (extra $), Guacamole (extra $), Harissa (extra $)).

Prevent mutually exclusive bases (e.g., can’t select both Saffron Rice and Coconut Rice unless “half/half” is intentionally supported).

Show/Hide logic responds instantly: selecting an item updates allowed toppings; disallowed options are hidden or disabled with an explanatory tooltip.

Test cases to run (per device):

Fruit Bowl → verify only Tahini/Lime appear; try to force hot/cold sauces or proteins (should be impossible).

Quesadilla (Chicken) → add Double Chicken; verify only hot-side toppings visible; Guacamole on side appears; add fries.

Quesadilla (Beef) → double beef + fries; verify price update.

Chicken Bowl → select base (one only), choose allowed hot/cold toppings; extras price increments; fries toggle.

Steak Bowl → same as chicken; confirm prices & availability mirror spec.

Attempt invalid combos via URL params or dev tools (if applicable) → server rejects or UI sanitizes.

Remove/add toppings then add to cart (if cart exists) → totals correct; no stale selections.

C. Content & Data Accuracy

Names, descriptions, allergen notes, spice indicators present where expected.

Prices: base vs extras line-items correct; tax & fees (if any) labeled accurately.

Photos: correct item images, no crops or distortions; alt text present.

D. Cart / Order (if enabled)

Add multiple items with different extras; subtotals update correctly.

Edit item in cart preserves topping logic and pricing.

Remove item works; empty cart state is helpful (CTA to continue browsing).

Checkout button disabled until minimum requirements met (e.g., location selection if needed).

E. Search / Filters (if present)

Search returns expected items; no duplicates; no “hidden” categories bleed in.

Filters (e.g., Vegetarian, Spicy) work and are combinable.

5) UX, Accessibility & Performance
Accessibility (WCAG-ish quick wins)

All actionable elements keyboard-navigable (Tab/Shift-Tab), visible focus ring.

Semantic HTML for headers, lists, buttons; no div-buttons.

Alt text on images; ARIA labels for icons.

Contrast checks pass for light/dark backgrounds.

Screen reader smoke test: item name → options → price → add action.

Performance & Stability

First load < 3s on 4G throttle; no render-blocking errors.

No console errors/warnings in Chrome DevTools (device and desktop).

Images optimized (webp/avif), responsive sizes; no 10MB hero images.

Cumulative Layout Shift doesn’t jump when images load.

6) SEO & Sharing (basic)

Unique titles and meta descriptions per main page.

OpenGraph/Twitter Card for homepage and menu; social preview looks right.

schema.org Restaurant and Menu (or MenuItem) structured data (optional but recommended).

7) Analytics & Logging (if enabled)

Pageview events fire once per page; no double firing.

Click events for “Add to cart,” “Add fries,” “Double meat,” and extras fire.

Error logging captures JS errors with URL & user agent.

8) Security & Edge Cases

No sensitive keys in client bundle.

Form inputs sanitized; no HTML injection in special instructions.

Rate-limit or debounce rapid add/remove (no price desync).

Graceful offline/slow network messaging (optional: PWA offline for menu viewing).

9) Acceptance Criteria (sign-off list)

✅ All device/browser combos pass layout and function.

✅ Menu logic enforces: Fruit Bowl restrictions; Quesadilla hot-side only + double meat; guac on side; fries on all bowls/quesadillas; extras pricing correct.

✅ No console errors; Lighthouse performance & accessibility “green.”

✅ All images optimized; no broken links; 404 exists.

✅ Content (names, prices, allergens) verified and approved.

10) Test Execution Checklist (what Replit should deliver)
Pre-Test

 Deploy latest build to staging with cache-busting.

 Provide build hash and commit ID.

 Provide data dictionary (items, allowed toppings, extras, prices).

During Test

 Complete all test cases above on the full device matrix.

 Record results in a shared sheet with columns:
ID | Page/Item | Steps | Expected | Actual | Device/Browser | Screenshot/Video | Severity (S1–S4) | Status

 Capture screenshots for each failure; console logs attached for JS errors; network HAR if performance issue.

After Test

 Fixes merged → redeploy staging → targeted re-test of failed cases + regression on impacted areas.

 Final production smoke test (home, one item per category, one checkout flow if applicable).

11) Severity & SLA

S1 (Blocker): Crash, can’t add/select items, wrong totals, broken layout on common devices. Fix before launch.

S2 (Major): Toppings logic incorrect, price mismatch, broken images, major accessibility issue. Fix before launch.

S3 (Minor): Typos, small spacing, low-risk a11y. Fix or backlog with ETA.

S4 (Nice-to-have): Cosmetic polish. Backlog.

12) Specific Test Scripts (copy/paste for QA)

TS-01 Fruit Bowl (iPhone 14 / Safari)

Open /menu/fruit-bowl → Add Item.

Verify only Tahini, Lime options show.

Try to reveal hot/cold sauces or proteins (should be hidden/disabled).

Add Tahini + Lime, add fries → Price = base + fries only (no sauce/protein upcharge).

Add to cart → totals correct.

TS-02 Quesadilla (Chicken) with Double Meat

Open /menu/quesadilla/chicken.

Verify only hot-side toppings are shown; cold toppings hidden.

Select Double Chicken; add fries; add to cart.

Verify price = base + double meat + fries; guacamole is listed on the side.

TS-03 Chicken Bowl with Extras

Choose Saffron Rice (verify you cannot also choose Coconut unless “half/half” is supported).

Add allowed toppings, then Quinoa (extra $), Harissa (extra $), Guacamole (extra $), Pineapple (extra $), Watermelon (extra $).

Price increments per extra; remove one extra → total decreases correctly.

TS-04 Quesadilla (Beef) negative test

Attempt to add cold-side toppings or guac inside by default → should be prevented; guac only as “on the side.”

Confirm tooltip/error message explains rule.

TS-05 Non-clickable Items Bug Regression

On home and category pages, click every visible tile.

Confirm each navigates to a valid detail page; no dead tiles remain.

TS-06 Responsive & Performance

Rotate mobile to landscape; refresh; no overlap or hidden CTAs.

Throttle to “Fast 3G”; time to interactive < 3s; no layout jump.

TS-07 Accessibility Quick Pass

Keyboard-only navigation: reach add buttons, modifiers, and cart; focus ring visible.

Screen reader reads item name → price → options → primary action in logical order.
