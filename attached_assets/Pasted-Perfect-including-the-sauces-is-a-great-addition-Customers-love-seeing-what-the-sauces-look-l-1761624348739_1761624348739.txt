Perfect — including the **sauces** is a great addition! Customers love seeing what the sauces look like — it helps them decide and makes the bowls feel more delicious and customizable.

Let’s add that into the plan 👇

## 🥗 Updated Plan for Replit: “Build Your Bowl” Visual Experience

### **Step 1: Menu & Photo Updates**

**Tell Replit to:**

1. **Remove** these items completely:

   * Plantain Chips
   * Guac and Veggie Bowl

2. You’ll provide:

   * 📸 **Base photos** — coconut rice, saffron rice, beans, plantains, cauliflower, etc.
   * 🥕 **Topping photos** — each topping on a clean white or transparent background.
   * 🍛 **Side photos** — same style and lighting for consistency.
   * 🥣 **Sauce photos** — each sauce shown either:

     * In a small cup/container (so customers can see color and texture), **or**
     * As a drizzle-style overlay (transparent PNG so it can be layered over the bowl).

---

### **Step 2: Visual Bowl Builder (Interactive Experience)**

#### **Option A: Layered Bowl Visualizer**

* Use **transparent PNGs** for all items (bases, toppings, sauces).
* Each selection adds a new image “layer” onto the main bowl image.
* When a sauce is chosen, it can appear as a **drizzle layer** (overlayed semi-transparent PNG).
* Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** or **React** on Replit.

💡 *Example flow:*

1. Customer chooses a **base** → bowl image with that rice appears.
2. Adds **beans**, **plantains**, etc. → layers stack visually.
3. Picks a **sauce** → a sauce drizzle appears over the bowl.
4. Final result: a full visual of their customized bowl, ready to add to cart.

Optional animations:

* Ingredients gently “fall” or “fade” in when selected.
* A reset button clears the bowl to start over.

---

#### **Option B: “Photo + Preview Panel”**

If you want something simpler:

* Show a **real photo** of each item next to the selection panel.
* As customers select items, their chosen items appear as small **preview thumbnails** or icons around the bowl.
* When they click “View My Bowl,” the site shows a **composite image** or a **summary photo grid** with all their selections.

### **Step 3: Design Notes for Replit**

When talking to your Replit dev, say:

> “We’re updating the menu by removing Plantain Chips and the Guac and Veggie Bowl. I’ll upload new photos for all bases, toppings, sides, and sauces.
> Then, I want to add a *‘Build Your Bowl’* feature so customers can actually see their bowl being made — base, toppings, and sauces included.
> Let’s make it visual and interactive, either with stacked transparent PNG layers (so it looks like a real bowl being built) or with another creative visual solution you think works best.”

### **Bonus: Sauce Visualization Ideas**

* A sauce drizzle animation that moves or pours slightly when selected.
* Hover or tap on a sauce to see it zoomed in with its description (e.g. *“Tamarind Glaze – tangy and sweet”*).
* Use sauce colors as accent highlights throughout the builder UI.

Would you like me to show you a **mockup** (visual example) of how the screen could look — including sauces, toppings, and the bowl preview area?
I can create a quick layout or animation concept so you can hand it directly to Replit.
